# Bond User Guide

![Ui.png](Ui.png)

Bond is a desktop app for managing personal tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast then Bond can help you keep track of your tasks much faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Notes about the command format:
- Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `todo TASKNAME`, `TASKNAME` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.


- Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g. `/n TASKNAME [/d DEADLINE]` can be used as `/n sleep /d 2024-02-29 10pm` or as `/n sleep`.


- Time can be in 24-hour format or 12-hour format. 
  * 24-hour format: `HHmm`
  * 12-hour format: `HH.[mm]am/pm`
